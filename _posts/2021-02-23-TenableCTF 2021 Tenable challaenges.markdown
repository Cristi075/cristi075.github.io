summary: A writeup for the Tenable challenges that I solved for TenableCTF 2021 and some of my thoughts on the one that I did not solve.

This is my writeup for the challenges from the Tenable category that were part of [TenableCTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1266).  

This being a CTF organized by Tenable, they had a category where you used their own tool (Nessus Essentials in this case) in order to find flags.  
They offered a NessusDB file (a fancy sqlite, basically) and you had to import it in your instance of Nessus Essentials.  

The flags that I obtained were:
- mutant
- dead
- knowledge
- command

I got them in a different order (mutant->command->knowledge->dead) but I will present them in this order.  

Also, I could not get the last flag (supercession).  
I will include my thoughts on that one at the end of this writeup. At the moment of writing this I still don't know where that one was hidden.  

### Setting up Tenable

### The NessusDB

### The 'mutant' flag
